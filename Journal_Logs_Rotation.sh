#This script uses the journalctl command to rotate the journal logs, when the total size of the logs exceeds the specified maximum size ($MAX_SIZE). The rotated logs are then compressed using the #gzip command, and any rotated logs that are older than the specified number of logs to keep ($NUM_TO_KEEP) are removed using the find command.
#It is recommended to run this script regularly, for example, by adding it to the system's cron job.
#This script is just an example, you should adjust the values of the variables to suit your needs and you should also test it before scheduling it as a cron job.
